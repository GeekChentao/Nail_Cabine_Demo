# Nail Cabin â€” Frontend Template

A mobile-first, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS template focused on pictures:
- Auto-advancing slider (every 5 seconds) with dots and arrows
- Tap-to-zoom photo gallery with a simple lightbox
- Clean design, responsive up to desktop

## How to use
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Replace gallery/slider image URLs in `index.html` with your own files (you can drop images into `./assets/` and change the `src` paths).
4. Adjust slider speed by changing `intervalMs` in `script.js`.

## Notes
- No build tools needed.
- All styles in `styles.css`, interactions in `script.js`.
- Fonts served via Google Fonts (Inter). Remove if not needed.
